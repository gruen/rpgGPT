###  Game World
The initial RPG you can explore with rpgGPR is Occidaria. Occidaria is a fictional world that draws inspiration from 476 AD Europe. In the land of Occidaria, remnants of the once-great Occidarian Empire lay scattered across a fractured realm of independent kingdoms and city-states. The slightly magical land holds whispers of ancient enchantments.
